# Quick Start Guide - Analytics System

## Starting the Server

1. Make sure MongoDB is running locally
2. Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

## Testing the System

1. Access the test page:

   - Open http://localhost:3000/test in your browser

2. Verify tracking is working:
   - Open browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect)
   - Check the Console tab - you should see:
     ```
     "Analytics tracker initialized successfully"
     ```
   - Check the Network tab to see tracking requests:
     - Look for POST requests to `/analytics` endpoint
     - You should see requests for:
       - Page views
       - Click events
       - Scroll events
       - Heartbeat signals

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the expected results:

1. Make sure MongoDB is running
2. Verify the server started without errors
3. Check browser console for any error messages
4. Ensure all files are in the correct locations:
   ```
   website-analytics/
   ├── public/
   │   ├── tracker.js
   │   └── test.html
   └── server.js
   ```

## Need Help?

1. Check if MongoDB is running:

```bash
mongosh
```

2. Verify server logs for any errors
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages

That's it! Your analytics system should now be collecting data from the test page.
